# SARC-NG API Reference

Welcome to the SARC-NG API Reference documentation. This section provides detailed information about all available API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## API Resources

The SARC-NG API is organized around the following main resources:

- **Buildings** - Physical structures where classrooms and resources are located
- **Classes** - Rooms or spaces within buildings
- **Resources** - Equipment and other physical resources
- **Reservations** - Bookings of resources and spaces
- **Lessons** - Scheduled teaching sessions

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. See the [Authentication](/api/authentication) section for details on how to authenticate your requests.

## Making Requests

The API accepts requests with JSON payloads and returns JSON responses. All endpoints use standard HTTP methods:

- `GET` - Retrieve resources
- `POST` - Create resources
- `PUT` - Update resources
- `DELETE` - Remove resources

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    /* Response data */
  },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      /* Pagination info if applicable */
    }
  }
}
```

For errors:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  }
}
```
