# User Rules

- Always eliminate legacy or backward-compatibility code paths.
– Strip out deprecated APIs, shims, polyfills, and version-specific branches.
– Replace them with current, officially supported APIs and patterns.
– Do not keep fallbacks, wrappers, feature flags, or “old-version” conditionals unless explicitly requested in the same prompt.
– Modernize project dependencies accordingly and delete unused packages.
– Ensure all code is forward-compatible with the latest standards.
– This rule applies to all codebases, regardless of language or framework.
– If a specific legacy code path is requested, it must be explicitly stated in the prompt.
